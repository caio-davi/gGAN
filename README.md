# Generating Labeled Genetic Synthetic Data to Non-Genetic Diseases

Creating large datasets for genetically influenced diseases is a hard and expensive task.
We intend to use the idea behind Generative Adversarial Networks to artificially create cohesive labeled genetic data to characterize genetically influenced diseases, specifically Dengue.

## Getting Started

Just compose build to create create `csce633_web`:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```
