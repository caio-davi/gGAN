# Generating Labeled Genetic Synthetic Data to Non-Genetic Diseases

Creating large datasets for genetically influenced diseases is a hard and expensive task.
We intend to use the idea behind Generative Adversarial Networks to artificially create cohesive labeled genetic data to characterize genetically influenced diseases, specifically Dengue.

You can find the paper for the project [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d8555ac21df820001d176ac).

## Getting Started

Just compose build to create the `csce633_web` docker container:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```
